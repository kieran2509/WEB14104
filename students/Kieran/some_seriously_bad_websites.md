##Some Seriously Bad Websites

I have been researching three different websites that i believe to be bad, all three of these websites are most certainly bad but they are all gaining faults for different reasons.

The [1st bad website](http://www.orpingtonfc.org.uk) I found was for Orpington Football club. This is my hometown and a football club that i would like to succeed in the future. I found that the general layout of the web page was rather boring and not very interactive. The colour scheme was very simple and at the bottom of the page you could find a picture of some grass that is presumably meant to be a football pitch. on some of the hyperlinks on the navigation bar, it is unclear that the mouse is on them and that you can click on them, as they remain a stationary colour. Also on some of the pages that you go on their is a point of no return. It takes you to a different page altogether where the navigation bar has completely disapeared and their are no buttons on the web page for you to return to the original page or a different page on the site.

The [2nd bad website](http://www.lingscars.com) is from Lings cars. This is a car rental company that quite simply has everything wrong with it. Im just still debating whether or not it is purely intentional to be so bad to make it so famous. Lings cars is cluttered with everything it seems, you simply dont know where to look first and feel like you have just been spammed with a load of ads. The website is quite funny and this does intice you to keep looking so all i can really say is that this is a bad website made really well.

The [3rd bad website](http://art.yale.edu) i was really surprised about as this is the website for Yale university school of Art. This website is actually really bad and is quite difficult to know where you actually are in the first place. For a universities website, you would have thought that it would be a little bit easier to use and a lot more aesphetically pleasing seeing that it is a university that specialises in art. Everything on the website is positioned to the left hand side and they also havent given a thought about how responsive their theme is. The website has been made up of everyone at the university, so presumably their is no one at the university that has a keen interest in the web and how it works.

The website that i am going to try and adapt to make it even better will be the 1st website, Orpington football club. This is because i have got a keen interest in football and even though this isnt the football club i support, it is still a football club that i would like to succeed in the future and to do that i believe they will need a more profesional looking website that eliminates all of the little bugs that the current one has. I will also be able to look at other football clubs and see how they have done their website and then i should be able to see what might be a good idea to add or remove from their website.
