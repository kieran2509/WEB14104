        <h1>How to make scones</h1>
        
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <p>225g/8oz self raising flour</p>
        <p>pinch of salt</p>
        <p>55g/2oz butter</p>
        <p>25g/1oz caster sugar</p>
        <p>150ml/5fl oz milk</p>
        <p>1 free-range egg, beaten, to glaze (alternatively use a little milk)</p>
        
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>1. Heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Lightly grease a baking sheet.</p>
        <p>2. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter.</p>
        <p>3. Stir in the sugar and then the milk to get a soft dough.</p>
        <p>4. Turn on to a floured work surface and knead very lightly. Pat out to a round 2cm thick. Use a 5cm cutter to stamp out rounds and place on a baking sheet. Lightly knead together the rest of the dough and stamp out more scones to use it all up.</p>
        <p>5. Brush the tops of the scones with the beaten egg. Bake for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden.</p>
        <p>6. Cool on a wire rack and serve with butter and good jam and maybe some clotted cream.</p>
