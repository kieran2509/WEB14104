#What are my learning goals for this unit?
For me, this unit will be able to give me the opportunity to really show what I can do. I should also be able to show what it is I can do independently and how I will go about making a website that will hopefully be better than the original. 

####1. Research

This will give me the chance to show my research skills in finding out what it is people like to see on a website and to find out more about the type of website I will be re-creating. Within this project their are many factors that I will be able to research, the main ones being about the company; its background information and who its target audience is. To be able to gain a better understanding of working with a client. Even though for this unit I won't specifically be dealing with the client I will still know what the client would like due to the research that I will be completing on them.

####2. HTML

To be able to express my knowledge of using HTML and to also learn a lot more about it. This will be a key factor to my success as HTML will give me the opportunity to change websites and make them different from what it would be if I wasn't using HTML and simply using more of a design platform.

####3. PHP and Web hosting

I would like to learn more about PHP and Web Hosting as this is what I will need to be able to do before I do anything. If I can't host a website then there won't be much point in making one as I will not be able to put it up on the web.
