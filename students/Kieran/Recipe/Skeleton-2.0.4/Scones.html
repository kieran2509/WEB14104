        <h1>How to make scones</h1>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>225g/8oz self raising flour</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>55g/2oz butter</li>
            <li>25g/1oz caster sugar</li>
            <li>150ml/5fl oz milk</li>
            <li>1 free-range egg, beaten, to glaze (alternatively use a little milk)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter.</li>
            <li>Stir in the sugar and then the milk to get a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Turn on to a floured work surface and knead very lightly. Pat out to a round 2cm thick. Use a 5cm cutter to stamp out rounds and place on a baking sheet. Lightly knead together the rest of the dough and stamp out more scones to use it all up.</li>
            <li>Brush the tops of the scones with the beaten egg. Bake for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden.</li>
            <li>Cool on a wire rack and serve with butter and good jam and maybe some clotted cream.</li>
        </ol>
